I am a PhD Candidate at Albert Einstein College of Medicine. My speciality is in cancer bioinformatics. I am a fellow of the PhD in Clinical Investigation (PCI) program at Einstein which places a strong emphasis on rigorous biostatistics training and clinical/translational research. My research involves bioinformatic analysis of transcriptomic data to discover new targetted therapies in cancer. My work especially focuses on studying the oncogene SKP2 in Osteosarcoma using single-cell and spatial transcriptomics under the mentorship of Dr. Deyou Zheng (PhD) and co-mentored by Dr. Bang Hoang (MD). I have also had the opportunity to collaborate with many others and contribute to large-scale single-cell transcriptomic studies of the prostate cancer immune microenvironment, heart development and deformities in transgenic models of 22q11.2 deletion sydrome, embyronic eye development, and the hematopoeitic stem cell bone niche.

Before Einstein, I completed a Masters in Biotechnology at Columbia University (graduating in 2019). I performed Masters thesis research under the mentorship of Dr. Tuomas Tammela at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center. There, I contributed single-cell transcriptomic bioinformatic analysis to the study of lung adenocarcinoma and pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma. My Master's thesis was titled "The Impact of Aging on Lung Adenocarcinoma".

At the start of my training, during my undergrad at New York University, I majored in molecular biology (grad 2016) and worked in the lab of Dr. Stephen Small using wet-lab techniques to study embryonic development. My first experience with computational methods and big data analysis began during a gap year under the mentorship of Dr. David Gresham at NYU's Center for Genomics and Systems Biology, where I performed reanalysis of bulk RNA-sequencing data to study metabolic perturbations in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.
