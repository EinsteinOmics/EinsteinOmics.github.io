## Skills and Interests

I am a computational biologist interested in cancer research. My work focuses on bioinformatics research and sequence data analysis for genomics and transcriptomics. I am highly proficient in R and transcriptomic data analysis. Through my training in the PhD in Clinical Investiation (PCI) fellowship at Einstein, I have also become proficient in general data analysis and basic machine learning, especially with regard to clinical data. I apply these skills to study cancer, which I have focused on since 2018. I have gained proficiency in molecular pathways and various "hallmarks" of cancer.

I plan to complete my PhD at Albert Einstein College of Medicine in May 2024. I am seeking industry R&D Bioinformatics careers with a special focus on research and cancer.

## Background

I am a PhD Candidate at Albert Einstein College of Medicine. My speciality is in cancer bioinformatics. I am a fellow of the PhD in Clinical Investigation (PCI) program at Einstein which places a strong emphasis on rigorous biostatistics training and clinical/translational research. My research involves bioinformatic analysis of transcriptomic data to discover new targetted therapies in cancer. My work especially focuses on studying the oncogene SKP2 in Osteosarcoma using single-cell and spatial transcriptomics under the mentorship of Dr. Deyou Zheng (PhD) and co-mentored by Dr. Bang Hoang (MD). I have also had the opportunity to collaborate with many others and contribute to large-scale single-cell transcriptomic studies of the prostate cancer immune microenvironment, heart development and deformities in transgenic models of 22q11.2 deletion sydrome, embryonic eye development, and the hematopoeitic stem cell bone niche.

Before Einstein, I completed a Masters in Biotechnology at Columbia University (graduating in 2019). I performed Masters thesis research under the mentorship of Dr. Tuomas Tammela at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center. There, I contributed single-cell transcriptomic bioinformatic analysis to the study of lung adenocarcinoma and pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma. My Master's thesis was titled "The Impact of Aging on Lung Adenocarcinoma". And before that, I graduated from NYU (grad 2016) after majoring in molecular biology, after which I completed an internship with Dr. David Gresham studying metabolism via RNA-sequencing, my first foray into sequencing data analysis and computational methods.
