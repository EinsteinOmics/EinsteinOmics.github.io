Welcome to the official page of the Einstein Biohackathon 2025.

Organized by the Omics Club, the Biohackathon aims to bring together participants from diverse backgrounds to tackle real-world problems through innovation and collaboration. The event is open to all MD, PhD, and MSTP students, as well as researchers—no coding experience required.

This five-part event includes interactive workshops and team-based challenges. The theme is development, and the central question we’re exploring is: “What does development mean to you?”

We hope you'll join us and share your perspective.
