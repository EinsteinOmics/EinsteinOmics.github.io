This is the official page of the omics hackathon 2025.

This student-led hackathon aims to bring together participants from various disciplines to tackle real-world problems through innovation and collaboration. The event is open to all MD, PhD, and MSTP students as well as researchers, regardless of coding experience. This is a 5 part event that will include workshops and team-based challenges. The theme is development and the central question we are trying to ask is ‘What does development mean to you?’. We hope you’ll join us in participating so we can get to know your perspective.
