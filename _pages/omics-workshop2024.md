## DATES, TIMES, AND LOCATIONS FOR OMICS WORKSHOP SESSIONS

Sessions 1 and 2 will feature zoom (hybrid) lectures on computing and statistics for Omics.

Sessions 3-7 will feature lectures and interactive code examples ("Vignettes") on specific areas within omics. Lectures on omics will be given by faculty while each vignette was designed by the indicated trainee with inputs from faculty and trainees.
