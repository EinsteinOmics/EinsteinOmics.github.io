This is the official page of the Intro to Omics workshop, a faculty-led, student-organized workshop meant to introduce concepts in computing, statistics, and bioinformatics for omics data analysis.



## [RSVP Google Poll form](https://forms.gle/iuymSPH7EMuePpSV9)
Please make sure to RSVP via this poll. Scheduling and location information is on the poll and below. Please note that locations have changed, see below on this site for the up to date locations.



## Pre-requisite materials for Omics workshop

We strongly suggest you familiarize yourself with terminal usage (unix), basic introductory R, and basic introductory Python before attending the Omics workshop sessions.

Here are some short Youtube videos:
- [How to use the Command Line - Terminal Basics for Beginners (Unix terminal)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XgBd6rjuDQ)

- [R programming for ABSOLUTE beginners (R)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FY8BISK5DpM)

- [Python in less than 10 mintues for Beginners (Python)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fWjsdhR3z3c)


Longer free tutorials are widely available online.




## DATES, TIMES, AND LOCATIONS FOR OMICS WORKSHOP SESSIONS

Sessions 1 and 2 will feature zoom (hybrid) lectures on computing and statistics for Omics.

Sessions 3-7 will feature lectures and interactive code examples ("Vignettes") on specific areas within omics. Lectures on omics will be given by faculty while each vignette was designed by the indicated trainee with inputs from faculty and trainees.

Sessions will run once a week, each Tuesday at 12PM starting from Tuesday Feb 13 - Tuesday March 26th. Each session will be about 1.5 hours. Food will be served. Sessions will be recorded and recordings and code vignettes will be made available at the end of the workshop.



**Belfer Riklis Auditorium**: Riklis auditorium can be accessed in the basement of the Belfer building. If entering through the main entrance of Belfer, pass the security desk and make a right. The staircase behind the security desk will take you down to the basement. The doors to Riklis auditorium will be to your right. Riklis is also accessible by the Belfer elevator by taking it to the basement. Riklis will be right across from elevator.


**Zoom info**: in person attendance is preferred. However, zoom info is available upon request, please email michael.camerino@einsteinmed.edu, xiangyu.zheng@einsteinmed.edu or alexander.ferrena@einsteinmed.edu.
