## DATES, TIMES, AND LOCATIONS FOR OMICS WORKSHOP SESSIONS

Sessions 1 and 2 will feature zoom (hybrid) lectures on computing and statistics for Omics.

Sessions 3-7 will feature lectures and interactive code examples ("Vignettes") on specific areas within omics. Lectures on omics will be given by faculty while each vignette was designed by the indicated trainee with inputs from faculty and trainees.

Sessions will run once a week, each Tuesday at 12PM starting from Tuesday Feb 13 - Tuesday March 26th. Each session will be about 1.5 hours. Food will be served. Sessions will be recorded and recordings and code vignettes will be made available at the end of the workshop.



**PLEASE NOTE, LOCATIONS HAVE CHANGED DUE TO MASSIVE INTEREST!**

**Lower Ed Center**: In Forchheimer building, entering from Morris Park (Main entrance), walk straight, past security desk, as you approach cafe area there are doors to the right side, walk downstairs. Alternatively, a standalone elevator is available. It is adjacent to the stairs after passing the security desk and the three elevators. Please note that it is separate from the three elevators near the security desk. The floor number is “S2”.

**Belfer Riklis Auditorium**: Riklis auditorium can be accessed in the basement of the Belfer building. If entering through the main entrance of Belfer, pass the security desk and make a right. The staircase behind the security desk will take you down to the basement. The doors to Riklis auditorium will be to your right. Riklis is also accessible by the Belfer elevator by taking it to the basement. Riklis will be right across from elevator.
