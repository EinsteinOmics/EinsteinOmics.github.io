This is the official page of the Intro to Omics workshop, a faculty-led, student-organized workshop meant to introduce concepts in computing, statistics, and bioinformatics for omics data analysis.

## Pre-requisite materials for Omics workshop

We strongly suggest you familiarize yourself with terminal usage (unix), basic introductory R, and basic introductory Python before attending the Omics workshop sessions.

Here are some short Youtube videos:
- [How to use the Command Line - Terminal Basics for Beginners (Unix terminal)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XgBd6rjuDQ)

- [R programming for ABSOLUTE beginners (R)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FY8BISK5DpM)

- [Python in less than 10 mintues for Beginners (Python)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fWjsdhR3z3c)


Longer free tutorials are widely available online.




## DATES, TIMES, AND LOCATIONS FOR OMICS WORKSHOP SESSIONS

Sessions 1 and 2 will feature zoom (hybrid) lectures on computing and statistics for Omics.

Sessions 3-7 will feature lectures and interactive code examples ("Vignettes") on specific areas within omics. Lectures on omics will be given by faculty while each vignette was designed by the indicated trainee with inputs from faculty and trainees.

Sessions will run once a week, each Tuesday at 12PM starting from Tuesday Feb 13 - Tuesday March 26th. Each session will be about 1.5 hours. Food will be served. Sessions will be recorded and recordings and code vignettes will be made available at the end of the workshop.




**Code Vignettes:** Note that the website for the code examples (called "vignettes") is now live. Please see the [code vignette website](https://github.com/EinsteinOmics/OmicsWorkshop) for all instructions on code vignette for both interactive coding follow-along as well as read-only options.
